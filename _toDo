Error checking on firebase read/write stuff


NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Circle.getBounds gives SouthWest and NorthEast coordinates, effectively a square
- At the moment, when map bounds are changed, the dom is completely regenerated. Ideally, only new items would be added and now out of view items
  would be removed. Though the problem I had with this is the following: When viewing a recent sighting and expanding view to be more inclusive, 
  the original sighting is pushed to bottom of the list even though it is still the most recent. I was able to accomplish this (minus the ability 
  to sort properly) by putting a check after the inBounds check to see if the dom element exists. Same happens with markers.

HOW RESULTS/BOUNDS SHOULD WORK
1. User location is determined and becomes center
2. User-defined radius is determined to create circle
3. Circle is used as map-BOUNDS
4. query last x days of results
5. if result is within map bounds, add markers and display list
6. when bounds are changed (map moved, zoomed, or circle changed), update list and markers
